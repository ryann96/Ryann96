In trimester 1, things started out a bit difficult. The first day was weird since there was a subsitute teacher for the first few weeks. i had problems even knowing how to get my website up. It took a few days to get up the website with a few office hours periods. The worst part for me has to be in week 6 when I was doing the hacks for the HTML DOM. That was very tricky. Somehow I got through the whole things with help from the teacher and classmates. For the game in the last 6 weeks, My whole group and I wasted the almost whole time making sprite animations. By the 11th week of the trimester, things were horrible. The website looked worst than the week before. We eventually got the game working in the last few days of the trimester.
