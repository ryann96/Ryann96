        .my-div {
            background-color: lightblue;
            padding: 10px;
            border: 1px solid blue;

    <!-- Using the div element to create a container -->
    <div class="my-div">
        <h1>This is a heading inside a div</h1>
        <p>This is some text inside a div element.</p>
        <a href="#">A link inside a div</a>
    </div>

    <!-- Another div element -->
    <div class="my-div">
        <p>Another div with different content.</p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
In this example:

We create two <div> elements with the class "my-div." The class attribute is used to apply CSS styles to these divs.
Inside each <div>, we can place various HTML elements, such as headings, paragraphs, and links.
We've also included some CSS styles to demonstrate how you can style the <div> elements using the "my-div" class.
The <div> element is a versatile tool for creating layouts and organizing content within an HTML document. It's often used in conjunction with CSS to control the appearance and layout of web pages.
