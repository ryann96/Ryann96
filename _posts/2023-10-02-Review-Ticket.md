 With the Web Programming basics assignment, this was the assignment I struggled the most. The part where I struggled the most was in the HTML DOM. I did not know what to do while switching the links and had to ask chat GPT for lots of help. After doing so much research from several sources like w3 schools and Youtube. It kind of made sense to me, but not 100%.
