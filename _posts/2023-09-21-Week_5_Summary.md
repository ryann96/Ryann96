 During week 5, I cloned the JS Input calculator and the calculator from week 2 on the teacher repository. Changes that I made to the JS Input calculator are a clear button. Changes I made to the week 2 calculator include things such as using the the number keys on the keyboard. My journey to get these two calculators wasn't easy. With the JS Input calculator, I had a hard time adding a letter grade for it. Whenever I insert the code from ChatGPT, the box you type in does not work anymore. Instead, I scrapped that concept, and used a clear button. When I copied the code from ChatGPT, the JS calculator worked without an issue. With the calculator from week 2, it first loaded all ove the place with black and white text. The solution was to insert the assets file from the teacher repository in my repository. When I did that, all the code worked just fine.
